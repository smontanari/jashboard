  <h3>Jashboard</h3>
  <p>Jashboard is a customisable multi-dashboard application where each dashboard can contain a variety of monitors 
    that dynamically fetch and report any sort of information.
  </p>
  <h4>Why?</h4>
  <p>
    I just wanted to have some fun and learn a bit of AngularJS.
    Initially the idea was to create a CI build monitor web application (right, like we needed another oneâ€¦), 
    but then I expanded the concept to be more general purpose and provide the ability to quickly extend the application and include any type of monitor you can think of.
